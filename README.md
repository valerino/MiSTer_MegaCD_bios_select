a little helper to overcome the lack of proper BIOS selection in MiSTer SegaCD/MegaCD core :)

# usage

1. just copy over the *games* and *Scripts* folders over your MiSTer SD, overwriting if needed.
2. whenever you need to use a different BIOS, go into MiSTer main menu and select one of Scripts -> SegaCD_EU/JP/US/RegionFree_bios
3. start the MegaCD core as usual.

cheers :)
